## The Titanic was a British ocean liner that struck an iceberg and sunk on its maiden voyage in 1912 from the United Kingdom to New York. More than
## 1,500 of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew died in the accident, making this one of the largest maritime disasters ever outside of war. The 
## ship carried a wide range of passengers of all ages and both genders, from luxury travelers in first-class to immigrants in the lower classes.
## However, not all passengers were equally likely to survive the accident. We use real data about a selection of 891 passengers to learn who was 
## on the Titanic and which passengers were more likely to survive.
