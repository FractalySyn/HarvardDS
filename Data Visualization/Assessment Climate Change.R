# A major determinant of Earth's temperature is the greenhouse effect. Many gases trap heat and 
# reflect it towards the surface, preventing heat from escaping the atmosphere. The greenhouse 
# effect is vital in keeping Earth at a warm enough temperature to sustain liquid water and life;
# however, changes in greenhouse gas levels can alter the temperature balance of the planet.
# 
# The greenhouse_gases data frame from dslabs contains concentrations of the three most significant
# greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide ( CO2 , abbreviated in the data as co2), methane ( CH4 , ch4 in

Carbon emissions were essentially zero before 1850 and have increased exponentially since then.
Carbon emissions in 2014 were about 4 times as large as 1960 emissions.

Carbon emissions change with the same trend as atmospheric greenhouse gas levels (co2, ch4, n2o)

Modern co2 levels are higher than at any point in the last 800,000 years.
There are natural cycles of co2 increase and decrease lasting 50,000-100,000 years per cycle.
In most cases, it appears to take longer for co2 levels to decrease than to increase.

# living and nonliving systems have time to adapt to new temperature and gas levels, but
