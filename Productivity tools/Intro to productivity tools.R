"A data analysis project is not always a dataset and a script. A typical data analysis challenge
may involve several parts, each involving several data files, including files containing the
scripts we use to analyze data. Keeping all this organized can be challenging. We will learn
to use the Unix shell as a tool for managing files and directories on your computer system.
Using Unix will permit you to use the keyboard, rather than the mouse, when creating
folders, moving from directory to directory, and renaming, deleting, or moving files. We also
provide specific suggestions on how to keep the filesystem organized."

"The data analysis process is also iterative and adaptive. As a result, we are constantly editing
our scripts and reports. In this chapter, we introduce you to the version control system
Git, which is a powerful tool for keeping track of these changes. We also introduce you to
GitHub1, a service that permits you to host and share your code. We will demonstrate how
you can use this service to facilitate collaborations. Keep in mind that another positive
benefit of using GitHub is that you can easily showcase your work to potential
employers."

"Finally, we learn to write reports in R markdown, which permits you to incorporate text
and code into a single document. We will demonstrate how, using the knitr package, we can
write reproducible and aesthetically pleasing reports by running the analysis and generating
the report simultaneously."
